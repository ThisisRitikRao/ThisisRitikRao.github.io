                <p>Hello!<br>My name is RITIK. I am glad to see you here.Thanks! for having a look at my portfolio. By the way,you can check out my <a href="work.html">Work</a> if you want.</p>
                <p>Don't bother or get stressed for the thing you can't do, because there's no reason to get bothered for the things you can't do. And also why get stressed for the things you could do, because you think you could do that then let do that,why to get stressedðŸ˜‰.<br>That's what I think and tell to others. If you fell I am wrong somewhere, I really welcome you for the correction. Be happy and also make sure that someone is happy too because of you.</p>
